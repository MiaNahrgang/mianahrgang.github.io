I am a second year PhD candidate at the University of Konstanz where I am part of the [Communication, Networks and Contention Group](https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/cnc/) led by Nils Weidmann. 

My research focuses on content moderation on social media platforms within the project [Transparency in Content Moderation](https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/cnc/news/details/es-geht-um-den-umgang-mit-falschinformationen-und-hassbotschaften/) led by Margaret Roberts (UC San Diego), Nils Weidmann (Konstanz) and Yannis Theocharis (TU Munich).
